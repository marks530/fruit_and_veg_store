### **Project Purpose and Scope**

Following the *CI Assessment Handbook 2020*, the aim of this project is to:

- *build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service*

I aimed to stick to this goal and the following section summarises what was needed in terms of requirements to complete the project. This excerpt was taken and adapted, from the **CI project requirements** documentation:

-	Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
-	Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).
-	Data Modeling: Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models...
-	User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so.
-	User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism)...
- 	Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout, subscription-based payments or single payments, donations, etc...
-	Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
-	Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.
-	Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
-	Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
-	Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
-	Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
-	Security: Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. 


### **Further Technical Insight** 

The site is built using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Framework. Also the following languages were employed :

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* Python 
* Bootstrap 

These languages are incorporated along with a relational database management system [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)). The site is deployed via [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) cloud hosting platform. Media and Static files are hosted via the [AWS S3 platform](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The site has the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ie) payment system software fully integrated. 

# **UX** 

As specified in the project requirements, the aim of this project is to aid the Users to manage and contribute to a common dataset. So naturally, a massive consideration would be on the User experience and the ease with which Users can navigate the site. 

Bearing this in mind, the goal of this milestone project was to create a web application using **Python**, the **Flask** libraries (a Python web framework) and a (NoSQL) Document-Based Database (in my case; **Mongo DB**) to construct the functioning app, as well as incorporate the main tenets of the *CRUD* operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). 

**CRUD** refers to [persistence storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)) and encompasses the following 4 main pillars:

**(1) Create**:
- add new, unique data to the database.

**(2) Read**:
- Fetch data from the database.

**(3) Update**:
- change and edit pre-existing database data.

**(4) Delete**:
- completely remove data from database. 


The aim was to create a simple, efficient and compact User friendly site, using intuitive design, clear and concise text and enticing colour images to attract and retain users. The simple layout would facilitate a pleasant experience and hopefully entice Users to return and/or recommend the site to friends or colleagues.   


# **User Stories**

In order to best display the User stories I decided to create a table with the following headings

**(1) The User**:
    - as a shopper who is anonymous or a registered User

    - Browsing the site

    - Registration and User Profiles

    - Sorting and Searching

    - Purchasing and Checkout

**(2) The Site Owner**:

    - Administering the Site

# Design

#### Font/Typography

The Lato font family from Google Fonts was used throughout the site

#### Colour Scheme and Imagery

The background colour of #555 was used and the images were taken from the Unsplash site 
[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/vegetables/) and credit was given to each of the image providers

### **Wireframes**

Wireframes are really important for a developer to design how it will look and function. I used the app [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to build my wireframes. I find it to be a really intuitive and user friendly application, which allows a user to build wireframes simply and efficiently. These wireframes provide the basis and first picture of the evolving website .

#### **Database**

**PostgreSQL**

I am using the PostgreSQL database in line with the example demonstrated in the course. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.


### **Database Schema


# **Features**

## **Existing features**

The following page elements are explained to guide the user to around the site.

**1. Home Page** 

The landing page contains a banner image and a simple message as well as links and buttons helping the user to navigate the site. The User can choose to shop and search the site in an anonymous mode or decide to register or login using the Register/Login button. 
The Navbar which is present throughout the site contains a search window where the user can enter a search term usually a product name or part of a name and the results will be displayed. The other elements in the Navbar allow the user to select the entire list of products "All Products" or select by category Fruit, Vegetable, Juice or Spices. As mentioned in the last paragraph the Register/Login button is displayed when the user is anonymous and the My Account button when the user is authenticated.

**2. Products Page** 

The main page on the site where the user can view and scroll to see all the products available to purchase. The products are displayed in a card format with an image, short description, price, category and rating. Clicking on the product image takes the user to the product detail page. If the user is a superuser he/she will see an Edit|Delete option to edit or delete products.

For all users there are many filters they can use to sort products. In this way the user can quickly organize products to suit their needs.


  >  -  Price low to high
  >  -  Price high to low
  >  -  Rating low to high
  >  -  Rating high to low
  >  -  Name A-Z
  >  -  Name Z-A
  >  -  Category A-Z
  >  -  Category Z-A
   



**3.Product Detail Page**

This page displays a single product with its image and product information including a description. For the superuser the Edit|Delete option is also available. Products can be purchased by weight or quantity and the corresponding buttons will be displayed.

**4. Login Page**

If a user already has registered, they can log into the site to access and begin shopping. They can enter their username and password and pressing the login button. If a user can't recall their password, they can follow the reset password logic. 

**3. Register Page**

A site user who would like to sign up for an account, they need to provide their email, a username and a password with password confirmation. Once the user successfully registers they can follow the `My Profile` link to fill in their contact details.

**4. Reset Password Page**

This page allows a user (who already has registered successfully) to recover a lost password by entering in their email (must be valid to receive an email from the site), follow the link generated on the email to a page to enter in a new password with password confirm, so that the user can continue shopping.

**5. User Profile Page:**

Once a user registers, they can fill in the form on the "My Profile" page and their details are saved and stored in the database . The values are automatically validated while the form is being filled out.

**5.1. Edit/Update Profile**:

The user can update their profile if any detail has changed.

**6. Shopping Bag Page**

A users shopping bag is part of the Navbar content and is available throughout the site and is the link which takes the user to the Bag page. It can either be empty or have contents. The bag logo also includes an amount in euros of the value of the contents of the bag. If the bag is empty the amount is €0.00, otherwise the value of the items in the bag is displayed. Clicking the bag link in the Navbar will take the user to the Shopping Bag page.
Once on the bag page the user is presented with the contents of the bag ie the items selected for purchase.
The user can decide to `Go to secure Checkout` or amend the contents of the bag or choose to `Keep Shopping`. The same options as those


The bag items are stored in the session when the user has selected an item to purchase. A standard feature on e-commerce sites but an interesting adaptation nevertheless. It may also lend itself to reminding users that they have something in their basket that perhaps they want to purchase. However, when the user logs out, all the carts contents are lost. 

**8. Checkout (Payment) Page**
The user is once again presented with the total amount (:euro:) currently in their basket (how much they will spend). The main form on this payment is the payment form where the user will have to fill out correct details (or be prompted with an error message). Once all the details of the payment form have been correctly entered, the user can hit the green `submit payment` button that will give the user a confirmation message that their payment was success (the full payment details are logged on the Stripe end). The user is then redirected back products page. Also below the payment form, is a recap of what's currently in the users basket (for referral)
