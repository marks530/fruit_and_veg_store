<h1 align="center">Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone 4 Project 

<h2 align="center">Machine :robot: </h2>

## **Project Introduction and Brief**

### *Title: **(https://marks530-fruitnveg1.herokuapp.com/)** - a fruit and vegetable e-Commerce website for anonymous and registered users*

*Full Stack Frameworks Milestone Project - Django*

This is a shopping site for users to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables

In line with the CI project requirements as well as CRUD methods, the site is aiming to build, and expand on, what has been taught in the CI course.

### *Note for External Tester*

*For the **Code Institute testing purposes**, I suggest (at some stage) logging into the site as the **Admin/SuperUser**, using the following details*: 
- Username: **marksmyth**   
- Password: **!zIPS123z!** 

*Also, for the sake of further testing, please only use the test number **`4242_4242_4242_4242`** when entering credit card number when paying for products using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ie)

### **Project Purpose and Scope**

According to the *CI Assessment Handbook 2020*, the aim of this project is to:

- *build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. You will set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service*

I aimed to stick to this goal and the following section summarises what was needed in terms of requirements to complete the project. This excerpt was taken and adapted, from the **CI project requirements** documentation:

-	Django Full Stack Project: Build a Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
-	Multiple Apps: The project must be a brand new Django project, composed of multiple apps (an app for each potentially reusable component in your project).
-	Data Modeling: Put some effort into designing a relational database schema well-suited for your domain. Make sure to put some thought into the relationships between entities. Create at least 2 custom django models...
-	User Authentication: The project should include an authentication mechanism, allowing a user to register and log in, and there should be a good reason as to why the users would need to do so.
-	User Interaction: Include at least one form with validation that will allow users to create and edit models in the backend (in addition to the authentication mechanism)...
- 	Use of Stripe: At least one of your Django apps should contain some e-commerce functionality using Stripe. This may be a shopping cart checkout, subscription-based payments or single payments, donations, etc...
-	Structure and Navigation: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).
-	Use of JavaScript: The frontend should contain some JavaScript logic you have written to enhance the user experience.
-	Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
-	Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
-	Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
-	Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
-	Security: Make sure to not include any passwords or secret keys in the project repository. Make sure to turn off the Django DEBUG mode, which could expose secrets.


### **Further Technical Insight** 

The site is built using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Framework. Furthermore, the CI project had some more technical requirements to fulfil, including using the follow languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* Python (+ Django)

These languages needed to be utilised in tandem with a relational database management system (recommended either [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)). The site is deployed via [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) cloud hosting platform. Media and Static files are hosted via the [AWS S3 platform](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The site has the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ie) payment system software fully integrated. As well as numerous additional libraries and API's dotted and employed throughout the site.



# **UX** 

As specified in the project requirements, the aim of this project is to aid the Users to manage and contribute to a common dataset. So naturally, a massive consideration would be on the User experience and the ease with which Users can navigate the site. 

Bearing this in mind, the goal of this milestone project was to create a web application using **Python**, the **Flask** libraries (a Python web framework) and a (NoSQL) Document-Based Database (in my case; **Mongo DB**) to construct the functioning app, as well as incorporate the main tenets of the *CRUD* operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). 

**CRUD** refers to [persistence storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)) and encompasses the following 4 main pillars:

**(1) Create**:
- add new, unique data to the database.

**(2) Read**:
- Fetch data from the database.

**(3) Update**:
- change and edit pre-existing database data.

**(4) Delete**:
- completely remove data from database. 


The aim was to create a simple, efficient and compact User friendly site, using intuitive design, clear and concise text and enticing colour images to attract and retain users. The simple layout would facilitate a pleasant experience and hopefully entice Users to return and/or recommend the site to friends or colleagues.   


# **User Stories**

In order to best display the User stories I decided to create a table with the following headings

**(1) The User**:
    - as a shopper who is anonymous or a registered User

    - Browsing the site

    - Registration and User Profiles

    - Sorting and Searching

    - Purchasing and Checkout

**(2) The Site Owner**:

    - Administering the Site

#### Browsing
| Site User/Site Admin | Function | Result|
| :------------------: | :------: | :---: |
|Shopper | View a list of Products| Select an item to purchase|
|Shopper | View Product details| View a Product image and availability|
|Shopper | View a Product details| Select by weight or number|
|Shopper | View a total list of Purchases| Update or remove|

#### Registration and User Profiles

| :------------------: | :------: | :---: |
|Shopper | View a list of Products| Select an item to purchase|
|Shopper | View a list of Products| Select an item to purchase|
|Shopper | View a list of Products| Select an item to purchase|
